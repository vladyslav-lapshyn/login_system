# Login System - Full Stack Application

This repository contains the source code for a full-stack web application with a login system. The project is divided into two main parts: the client-side (frontend) and the server-side (backend).

## Client (Frontend)

### Technologies Used:
- React
- Redux
- React-hook-form
- Material UI

### Installation:
1. Navigate to the `client` directory:

```bash
cd client
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

### Description:
The client folder contains the frontend of the application. It is built using React as the main library for building user interfaces. Redux is used for state management, and React-hook-form is employed for handling form-related functionality. Material UI provides a set of pre-designed components for a consistent and modern look.

## Server (Backend)

### Technologies Used:
- Node.js
- Express
- mongoose
- bcrypt
- jsonwebtoken

### Installation:
1. Navigate to the `server` directory:

```bash
cd server
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the server:
```bash
npm start
```

### Description:
The server folder contains the backend of the application. It is built using Node.js, and Express is used as the web application framework. Mongoose is employed for interacting with the MongoDB database. Bcrypt is used for password hashing, and jsonwebtoken is used for creating and verifying JSON Web Tokens for user authentication.

# Deployment:
### Frontend: https://login-system-frontend.onrender.com
### Backend: https://login-system-backend-di1u.onrender.com

# How to Use:
1. Access the frontend URL to interact with the login system.
2. The frontend communicates with the backend for user authentication.
3. Explore the codebase for a deeper understanding of the implementation.
